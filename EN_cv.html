<h2>About me</h2>
I am currently an undergraduate student at College of Architecture and Landscape ,Peking University. I am going to get the master's degree in June 2023.
Before that, I obtained the Bachelor of Engineering degree in Xi' an University of Architecture and Technology in June 2020.
During my postgraduate period, my major work is quantifying perceptual environment characteristics based on spatio-temporal mobile data and street view images. </br>
My research interests include: Urban Planning and Design, Urban Visual Intelligence , Urban Analytics , Digital Humanities.

<summary>Abstract.</summary>
<p>In order to understand the indoor and outdoor summer thermal environments of traditional largespace buildings in southern Xinjiang under the typical hot-arid climate, the temperature and the relative humidity of
the main tomb, inner hall, side hall, and outer hall of the Grand Mosque, and the outdoor environment in the Apakh
Khoka Mazar in Kashgar were measured. We found that the temperature difference between day and night outside
was remarkable during the summer days in Kashgar, and the thermal stability of the main tomb chamber was
better than that of the inner and outer halls of the Great Mosque. The main reasons for the good thermal stability of
the main tomb chamber were the large thermal inertia of the enclosure structure materials, the small opening area
and building shape coefficient, and the thermal buffer zone inside. The protruding depth of the outer hall of the
Great Mosque was closely related to the angle of the sun. Outdoor greening and water as an underlying surface
had better cooling and humidifying effects than the square. The results could serve a reference for the indoor and
outdoor climate response design of local modern large-space buildings</p>

<p>It is generally believed that severe social  segregation 
is primarily a phenomenon observed in the New World and the Third World and is not significant in East Asia, the former Soviet Union 
and Western Europe. However, this conclusion is based on the "static observation" of social segregation, which represents class agglomeration 
and division in the perspective of residential space such as the "brownstone district - slum" dichotomy. Therefore, we can explore whether the 
spatial pattern in the  "dynamic perspective" shows a different phenomenon of social segregation if the movement of people is considered on the
 basis of the static population distribution.</p>
