### Introduction

From the perspective of Critical regionalism, the domination of modernist "International Style" architecture is considered as a global problem (Eggener, 2002; Frampton, 1993).  There has been a long history of the criticism of the " a thousand cities with one image " style in China, too.

Meanwhile, "one city with a thousand images" is another phenomenon  frequently observed in  cities  from the perspective of geography. It is widely believed that the difference of city image perception exist between tourists and residents.(Francescato & Mebane, 1973; Orleans, 1973; Pearce, 1977; Wartmann et al., 2021; M. Wu et al., 2021) 

Taking several Chinese cities as an example, we plan to explore what kind of scenes Chinese cities present under the dual backgrounds of "a thousand cities with one image " and "one city with a thousand images".

### Methodology

Through reviewing the existing theories, knowledge and experience in architecture and environmental cognitive science , we  construct a complete analytical framework that can accommodate large-scale quantitative measurements based on computer vision .

      The bars in the figure represent the difference between the two distances, which is the native-tourist distance in a city minus the distance between the city and other cities. Green represents a positive result and red represents a negative result.

      The bar chart represents the difference between two distances, which is the result of distance between locals in two cities minus the distance between tourists in the two cities. Green represents positive results and red represents negative results.



#### Conclusion

We find that the visual spatial characteristics of Beijing, Ningbo and Taiyuan are not "one side" either in terms of statistical distribution or distance comparison, especially in terms of scale, naturalness, enclosure and color. We cannot find a city that is significantly more similar in every dimension between these three cities, and no city can be completely different from the other two cities. Therefore, we believe that "a thousand cities with one image" is an oversimplified and inaccurate statement.  At the same time, the perception difference between "locals and tourists" also exists in various dimensions, but it cannot be found from the comparison of the three cities that the differences between the two groups of people generally exist. 

Finally, we compare the degree of the phenomenon of "one thousand cities" and "one city with a thousand images". The result shows  visual spatial differences between cities are larger than the visual spatial differences  among people within cities in almost all dimensions except for the imageability, which further indicates that "one city in one thousand" and "one city in one thousand" have not reached a very significant degree. What is more, the result shows "a thousand cities with one image" argument is likely a bias in tourists' perspectives.
