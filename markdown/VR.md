### Introduction

Traditional urban designing is based on designers' subjective experience, which is always criticized  for a lack of quantitative evidences support. Not surprisingly, a lot of urban planning/design failed because we could not get the true evaluation before the scheme was built. In order to  make the design process more traceable, we designed a VR experiment with  variable controlling  and emotion measurement to find the appropriate parameters of key factors affecting emotional experience.

### Method and Data

We follow the  "Iterative Design" way and  plan to adjust scheme variable constantly based on the correlation analyses and emotional responses until the experience results converge, which is like the Back Propagation of neural network to some extent.

### Experimental Scheme Explosure

We aim to transform the a commercial street in a  urban renewal project. According to the actual situation, we choose four significant classified variable as the the  design parameter: **facade color , parking models, sidewalk planting , shop signboards**. We create 8 schemes through different combination with these elements:

###  Emotion Measurement 

A situation will arouse  two kinds of  emotional responses: **Peripheral nervous system and Central nervous system**. So we recorded the subjects' objective physiological indicators, such as HR and EDA with the measurement Instrument. Meanwhile, we recored the subjective assessment ,which included PANAS standard questionnaires and five kinds of  important emotions according to Zamanifard(2019). In the end, we invite 30 students to take part in our experiment.

#### Conclusion

1. If you want to improve the **walking experience** in the business street (related to Safety, Comfort, Pleasure and PA-NA):

   * Use vertical shop signboards instead of horizontal signboards.

   * Keep the parking  away from pedestrians as far as possible.

   * Use shade trees as alee-trees to keep higher enclosure rather than shrubs .

   * Keep the facades in one color scheme or as more as possible.

     

2. If  you want to **Vitality**（related to HR, EDA, Inclusive, Activity):

   * Pay attention to the design of the entrance and the layout of the street text, which are the focuses of pedestrians' attention.
   * Keep the vision  open in the appropriate place.
   * Keep the facades in contrast color scheme.
